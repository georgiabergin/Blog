My favorite website is https://www.manrepeller.com/ for several reasons.
1) The content. I love fashion and women's issues.
2) The colors. The Man Repeller design team really is something else. If I ever need color inspiration, I pay the site a visit.
3) The grid. The home page has a crazy tabloid feel, but none of the crazy tabloid content.
